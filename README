sodium is designed to be a dvd cover art viewer and movie launcher. 

Basic usage is: sodium /path/to/images

It loads a 3 x 3 grid of images each at 300 x 300 pixels. You can navigate via
the following:

	Keys

	Escape, q			Quit
	Page Up, Up Arrow		Page Up
	Page Down, Down	Arrow		Page Down
	Home				First Page
	End				Last Page
	c				Toggle cursor on/off

	You can also scroll with the mouse wheel.

You can also click on an image to have the video for that played (if it's 
available). Currently this is managed through a mapping file that maps image 
names to video names and the player to use and the arguments to pass to the
player.

It takes the form of a pipe (|) seperated fields flat file, e.g

	taken.jpg|action/Taken.mkv|xine|-f

taken.jpg 		is the name of image shown in sodium
action/Taken.mkv 	is the path to the video
xine			is the command to lauch to play the video
-f			is the arguments to pass to the video player

Currently the video location is hard coded to /media/sata_2/videos/dvds/ and 
action/Taken.mkv is relative to that.

The mapping file should be called .movie-list and placed in the same location
as the images being displayed.
