sodium is designed to be a dvd cover art viewer and movie launcher. 

Basic usage is: sodium /path/to/images size [/path/to/videos]

size is the size of the window to display in pixels. It should be at least 
300 and be a multiple of 300, e.g 300, 600, 900 etc

You can optionally specify a path to videos that cna be played when clicking
on an image. See below.

It loads a 3 x 3 grid of images each at size / 3 squared pixels. E.g if you
specified a size of 900 the images would be 300x300 each.

You can navigate via the following:

	Keys

	Escape, q			Quit
	Page Up, Up Arrow		Page Up
	Page Down, Down	Arrow		Page Down
	Home				First Page
	End				Last Page
	c				Toggle cursor on/off

	You can also scroll with the mouse wheel.

You can also click on an image to have the video for that played (if it's 
available). Currently this is managed through a mapping file that maps image 
names to video names and the player to use and the arguments to pass to the
player. To use this pass the optional /path/to/videos argument that is the 
top level directory where the videos are held. The videos listed in the 
mapping file should be specified relative to this directory.

It takes the form of a pipe (|) seperated fields flat file, e.g one entry 
would look like:

	taken.jpg|action/Taken.mkv|xine|-f

taken.jpg 		is the name of image shown in sodium
action/Taken.mkv 	is the relative path to the video
xine			is the command to lauch to play the video
-f			is the arguments to pass to the video player

The mapping file should be called .movie-list and placed in the same location
as the images being displayed.
