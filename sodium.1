.SH NAME 
sodium - DVD cover art viewer & movie launcher

.SH SYNOPSIS 
sodium <image path> <size> [video path]

.SH DESCRIPTION 
Browse a directory of images which can be linked to movies to launch them.

.TP
.B image path
The path to the directory that contains the images to view
.TP
.B size
The size in pixels of the viewer window to create. Must be a multiple of 300
and at least 300.
.TP
.B video path
An optional path to the location where the videos are stored. This acts like a
base path and you can have any sort of tree under it.

.SH FILES
You can optionally create a file called \fB.movie-list\fR in the images
directory. This is a mapping file that maps images to movies and takes the
form:-

.RS
image|movie|player|args
.RE

e.g

.RS
taken.jpg|action/Taken.mkv|totem|--fullscreen
.RE

The movie path can be relative to the video path if given at runtime. Or it
can be absolute. You can specify multiple paths in there.

The file must end with a blank line.
